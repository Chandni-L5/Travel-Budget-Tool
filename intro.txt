This programme will analyze your expenses when planning a holiday abroad and advise if you have enough saved within your budget to book the trip, or whether you should save a bit more to  increase your budget.

A summary of your results will be printed to a google document so you can refer back to this later. A link to this document will be provided for you at the end of the programme.


The first set of questions will assist the app in understanding your criteria and requirements for this trip.

Let's begin!
